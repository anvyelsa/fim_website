		<p>in the state of Kerala, the sudden death of the Chief minister P. K. Ramdas (PKR), leaves a huge vacuum in not only the electoral and leadership sphere of his party (Indian United Front) but also that of the state. Ramdas is survived by his daughter Priyadarshini "Priya" Ramdas and son Jathin Ramdas. Senior leaders of the IUF party, Mahesha Varma and P. S. Peethambaran both expects to be nominated as the next chief minister of the state, but the front-runner for the seat is Stephen Nedumpally, Ramdas' confidant and rumoured step-brother of Priya and Jathin. Stephen has much larger public support than any other member of the party.
